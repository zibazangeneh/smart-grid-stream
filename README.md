## 💡 Why I Built This

Germany's *Energiewende* — the national energy transition — generates enormous amounts of sensor data across the power grid. As a data engineer based in NRW, I wanted to build something that reflects a real problem in this region: how do you process hundreds of thousands of smart meter readings in real time, detect anomalies, and make the data available for analysis?

This project is my answer. It is not a tutorial follow-along — I designed the architecture, chose the tools, and built it end to end. The goal was to close the gap between the batch ETL work I have done professionally and the streaming, cloud-native stack that modern senior DE roles in Germany require in 2026.

## 🧠 Key Engineering Decisions

**Why `kafka-python-ng` instead of `kafka-python`?**
`kafka-python` is unmaintained and broken on Python 3.12+. `kafka-python-ng` is the community-maintained drop-in replacement. Switching requires changing only one line in requirements.txt — the right call for any new project in 2026.

**Why watermarks on the Gold layer?**
Smart meter data arrives out of order due to network conditions and device buffering. Without a watermark, PySpark would hold state indefinitely for every open window. The 2-minute watermark lets Spark handle late events while bounding memory usage — silently broken aggregations without it are a common production incident.

**Why key Kafka messages by `meter_id`?**
Stateful streaming aggregations require all events for the same key to land in the same partition. Keying by `meter_id` guarantees this. Using a random or round-robin key would cause incorrect windowed aggregations downstream — a subtle but critical correctness requirement.

**Why local Delta Lake instead of Azure Databricks?**
Azure free tier limits vCPU quota to 4 cores — too small for a Databricks cluster. Running PySpark locally with Delta Lake preserves the exact same API and Medallion architecture. The code is cloud-ready with a single config change (`master("local[*]")` → Databricks cluster URL).

**Why `dbt parse` in CI instead of `dbt build`?**
`dbt build` requires a live Snowflake connection, which means CI would consume warehouse credits on every PR. `dbt parse` validates all Jinja templates, SQL syntax, and model references without any database connection — fast, free, and catches the majority of real errors before merge.

**Why incremental materialization on `fct_energy_consumption`?**
The fact table grows continuously as new meter readings arrive. Recomputing the full table on every dbt run would re-aggregate all historical data. The incremental model only processes new hours since the last run, which scales linearly rather than quadratically with data volume.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Event streaming | Apache Kafka (Confluent 7.5) | Industry standard; partition-keyed for stateful aggregations |
| Stream processing | PySpark 3.5.3 + Delta Lake 3.2.0 | Native windowing; watermarks; ACID transactions on streaming data |
| Medallion storage | Delta Lake (local) / Azure ADLS Gen2 (cloud) | Same API locally and in cloud; time-travel for debugging |
| Data warehouse | Snowflake | Separation of storage and compute; auto-suspend on idle |
| Transformation | dbt Core 1.11 + dbt-utils | Version-controlled SQL; lineage graph; incremental models |
| Orchestration | Apache Airflow 2.9 (Docker) | DAG-based scheduling; task-level retry; clear failure visibility |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions | dbt parse on every PR — no broken models reach main |
